# E4.Test1 is Web form application developed in .NET framework
Used an XML file and DB which can be found in the APP_Data folder. This path can be changed in the web config while testing
I have used Gijgo and JQuery components to display data in table
All CRUD operations are being executed by web methods that can be found in the file AjaxProcess.aspx.cs
XML as DB converted to Object then to JSON. The object here is the DTO
Methods can be tested in the unit test project
